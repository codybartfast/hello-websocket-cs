# Hello WebSocket

#### A Simple Example of a .Net WebSocket Client.

A very simple example of using the WebSocket Client in .Net 5.  It sends a single message to the server at [echo.websocket.org](https://www.websocket.org/echo.html) and then prints the returned message.

It doesn't deal with any exceptions or anything other than the basic '[happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path)'.
